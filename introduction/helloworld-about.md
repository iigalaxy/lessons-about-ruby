Hey! this is the start of the "guide/lessons" about Ruby. , **IMPORTANT** _You need having installed Ruby_ [How?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzijLscV3BQ)

Let's gooooo ðŸ‘€

# The first we will start with a ``Hello World``
```rb
puts "Hello world"
```
# Good, now open terminal and writes ```ruby helloworld.rb```, in the terminal you will see this:
```rb
Hello world
``` 
Basically what you have written in the puts. When you run/execute[with the above](https://github.com/iigalaxy/lessons-about-ruby/blob/main/introduction/helloworld-about.md#good-now-open-terminal-and-writes-ruby-helloworldrb-in-the-terminal-you-will-see-this) the terminal it will close in little bit.

# How to solve this?
Easy, with:
```rb 
gets()
```
# What does gets do?
It is used to prevent the terminal from closing.

Until next time!
Happy coding :)
